# Husky Reads

## About Husky Reads
The purpose of Husky Reads to create a simpler, more straightforward web application similar
to GoodReads that allows our users to look for books to read, keep track of books previously
read, currently reading, and/or planning to read. Along with that, this project serves as a
learning experience for the members of the HuskyReads team, and build confidence in the members
of our team to pursue future projects. This is the first project ever completed by the Husky
Coding Club and we will use the experience we've gained from this project to provide the
groundwork for future project teams to build and grow from.

## Developers

- **Project Lead:** Elliot Schumacher
- **Front-end Developers:** Vikram Nithyanandam, Audrey Kho, and Juda Fernandez
- **Back-end Developers:** Elliot Schumacher, Frank Hou, and Sidharth Lakshmanan

## Configuration Instructions
1. Clone the repository and open it in your IDE, preferably VSCode.
2. Open your IDE Terminal starting at the HuskyReads directory.
3. Perform the following Terminal commands to have all node modules set up:

```
cd front-end/app
npm install
cd ../..
cd backend/app
npm install
```

If you want launch the application, perform the following commands in your Terminal
starting at the top project directory:

```
cd front/app
npm start
```

This will launch the application locally on your machine

The back-end code is hosted on Heroku. You do not need to launch it on your personal machine,
since that would require a *.db file and a MySQL setup.

More information is available under `back-end/API_Documentation`.
